Nice work Bhagyashree!!!

Your assignment is not quite ready. But don't fret.
We would like to see your re-submission after making the changes.
Follow below Priority sequence:

    Function
    Logical
    UI

=======================================
Need Improvements
[A] Login & Register

UI
1. Email & password should be along with first & last name.

Validation
1. Login page should have validation once use click on submit without any inputs.

CSS
1. Submit buttons must have cursor-pointer

Code
1. Fix Needed: <a> <input/></a>. Use best Practice
[B] Todo

    Edit page, there is no meaning to enable/show save button if task is not in edit mode.

UI
1. text-align should be left
2. Set reminder, make todo public both must be able to toggle.

Validation
1. Todo: reminder date should in future.
2. Date range must be able to select start date as current date.
3. Edit todo must have all validations. Title can not be empty in either of the case.

CSS
1. Description focus should be handled.
2. List of task has UI issue with title

=====
[C] General:

    A form should also been submitted via Keyboard Enter kye press event.
    On login, user should be redirected to todo list.
    Please fix console errors
    One could not see mytodopage.html and profilepage.html without login. Similarly, one could not visit login page once user is in session.
    Input field should have proper spacing (padding). Ref: Create Todo page
    avoid unnecessary variable declaration in code.
    Missing reusable functions, avoid lengthy function (learn more about single responsibility and open closed principal).
    Please refer the below youtube chanel for writing clean code

    Code alignment & Formatting MUST BE proper (HTML/JS/CSS)
    eliminate extra lines and spaces
    Follow naming convention for css class declaration & <input> name declaration
    You can use other query selector for DOM manipulation other than getElementById in different cases.

=====
Best Practice:

    Password should store in encrypted
    Try to use es6 features in code.

====
Excellent Advance Points

====

    User must be able to filter/search through list Todo items on the basis of
    Date range
    Categories selected
    isDone status
    isPending ( due date greater than current )
    => It would be great if you have applied all filler all together

    Clear filter expected on task
    => There is no way to clear filter once you apply the category filter without manual refreshing page.

    You can use focus/blur/change events for validation\
